SimpleLoginApp using Java Swings


# Simple Login Page using Java Swing
This is a basic Java Swing application that demonstrates a simple login page with a username and password field. When the user enters their credentials and clicks the "Login" button, the application checks if the credentials are correct and displays a success or failure message accordingly.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any text editor for Java.
Running the Application
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP archive.

Open the project in your chosen IDE or a text editor.

Locate the SimpleLoginApp.java file and run it.

bash
Copy code
java SimpleLoginApp.java
The login page window will appear.

Enter a username and password.

Click the "Login" button to see the login result.

Customization
You can customize the application by replacing the isValidCredentials method with your own authentication logic. In this example, we have a simple hard-coded check for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would typically validate credentials against a database or another source.

java
Copy code
// Replace this method with your authentication logic
private static boolean isValidCredentials(String username, String password) {
    // In a real application, you would check the credentials against a database or some other source
    // For this example, we'll hardcode a username and password for demonstration purposes
    return username.equals("user") && password.equals("password");
}
